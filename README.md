# LumosQuad Minimum for Windows

This is my course work for Electromagnetism, a Windows version of academic software LumosQuad(Kim T, Lin M C. Fast animation of lightning using an adaptive mesh[J]. IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics, 2007, 13(2): 390-402. ) , which is available at  http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/FAST_LIGHTNING/lumos.html . The original version cannot work on the latest Windows 10 OS. Hence I modified it so that it can work on Windows 10 OS. In addition, I also get rid of FFTW and OpenEXR so that not external dependency is needed when compiled. However, you need to use Mathematica or Matlab to produce the final image from the grey scale matrix which the program produce. And kissfft is used instead of FFTW. In addition, OpenMP is utilized to speed up the stimulation. I hope you will find it helpful. If you come across any issue, please contact me.
